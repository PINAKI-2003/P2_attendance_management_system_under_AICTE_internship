# P2_attendance_management_system_under_AICTE_internship

## I have completed the project by developing an attendance management system that utilizes face recognition technology to streamline the attendance tracking process. The system was implemented using Python and machine learning libraries, incorporating OpenCV for face detection and recognition. A user-friendly interface was built using Tkinter for local interaction and Streamlit for web-based deployment, enabling seamless usage in educational and corporate environments. The project included dataset preprocessing, model training, and testing, leveraging advanced algorithms to ensure high accuracy and reliability. This end-to-end solution addresses the challenges of manual attendance processes by automating them with modern technology, enhancing both efficiency and accuracy.
